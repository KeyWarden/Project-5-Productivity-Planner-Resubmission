# PROJECT 5 - PRODUCTIVITY PLANNER 'PROPLANX' FRONT-END

The goal of this site was to create a Productivity Planner That would allow people to do the following:

* Create an account.
* Create Tasks with due dates and descriptions.
* Create Groups associated with those tasks, with member numbers and descriptions (if needed).

Unfortunately, due to time constraints here at home, I have not been able to finish this project wholly. As such, I'm going to list below what has been made and what is yet to be made.

### What I did

I have made the majority of the basic framework of the frontend, allowing users to move between the various pages of the app. Users can successfully sign in, sign up, and sign out. What is available for a user changes based on their status - when not signed in they can only look at the Home page, sign in, or sign up. When signed in, the user is then able to see the Tasks and Groups pages as well as the Home page, and of course they can also sign out. The user can also create new tasks and upload them to the database. I have also managed to finish the backend.

### What I haven't done

I unfortunately have not managed to make it so the user can actually view the tasks they have created. I aslo have regettably failed to make it so the user can do anything with groups at this time. The user is also not currently able to edit or delete their account through the app, nor can they edit or delete any tasks or groups they have made. The user is also very limited in what they can post in regards to tasks, as they can currently only post the title of the tasks. The final missing feature is that the user cannot view individual tasks or groups in greater detail in the current version of the app.

### Code Used

Some of the code for my front-end was originally written for my inital submission in another repository, which can be found [here](https://github.com/KeyWarden/Project-5-Productivity-Planner/tree/main).

I also made use of code and templates from the Moments Walkthrough Project.
