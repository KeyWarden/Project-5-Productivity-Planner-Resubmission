# PROJECT 5 - PRODUCTIVITY PLANNER 'PROPLANX' BACK-END

The goal of this site was to create a Productivity Planner That would allow people to do the following:

* Create an account.
* Create Tasks with due dates and descriptions.
* Create Groups associated with those tasks, with member numbers and descriptions (if needed).

Unfortunately, due to time constraints here at home, I have not been able to finish this project wholly. As such, I'm going to list below what has been made and what is yet to be made.

### What I did

I have successfully made a backend capable of handling all the necessary data. Users can create accounts, post tasks, edit tasks, delete tasks, post groups, and delete groups as needed, and even view data for individual tasks and groups outside of the editting process.

### What I haven't done

I unfortunately have not managed to finish the frontend for this project.

### Code Used

Most of the code for my back-end was originally written for my inital submission in another repository, which can be found [here](https://github.com/KeyWarden/Project-5-Productivity-Planner/tree/main).
